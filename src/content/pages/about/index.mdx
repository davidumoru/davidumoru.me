If you landed here, it probably means you have questions either about who I am
or about this site you're on. I'll do my best to answer everything.

&nbsp;

## TL;DR for the people with short attention spans  

I am a developer and freelance designer, based in Nigeria. I've been sharing my work and thoughts here since April 2024. 
You can reach out to me at hey@davidumoru.me.

## Extended Bio  

I was born in the early 2000s in Nigeria, where I still live.
Growing up, I had early access to a computer and the internet, so I spent a lot of time googling stuff.
I was always interested in how things were built- games, websites, and robots (I watched a lot of sci-fi, lol).
That curiosity shaped the way I learn: if I find something interesting, I dig into it and figure it out.

I was also always drawn to art. I grew up drawing and painting.
When I got my first PC (a Dell Latitude running Windows XP) in elementary school,
I started playing around with MS Paint. I'd spend hours creating pixel art and cartoon characters.

My first actual introduction to programming was in middle school.
We had this "Intro to Python" class when I was in 7th grade.
The class only held about three times, but it was enough to get me interested.
At this point, I didn't even know much of what it was capable of. I just knew I enjoyed what was happening.

Later, we had (yet another three-or-so-class) crash course in web development.
It was on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.  
This time, I actually somewhat understood how it worked and what it was capable of.
From there, I started building static websites for fun.
I was also designing user interfaces (in MS Paint!) for the websites I was building.
I didn't even know UI design was a thing then.

By high school, I picked up CorelDRAW (later switching to Adobe Illustrator in college).
At the same time, I got deeper into software while prepping for my Cambridge O' Levels.
I learned more Python, as well as data structures and algorithms.

So when it came time to pick a college major, Computer Science felt like the obvious choice.
And now, that's what keeps me employed :)

## About this Site  

This site is my little corner of the internet. I'm constantly tweaking it to improve the experience.
I post nicheless notes, and once in a while, write on software or design.

Writing is kind of new to me, but I figured it helps me understand my thoughts better.

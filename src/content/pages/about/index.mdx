If you landed here, it probably means you have questions either about who I am
or about this site you're on. I'm gonna attempt to answer them all!

## TL;DR for the people with short attention span

I am a developer and designer freelancer, and I have written on
this blog since 2024. You can email me at hey@davidumoru.me

## Extended Bio

I was born in the early 2000s in Nigeria, where I still live. Growing up, I was fascinated by Disney,
Nickelodeon, and art. I started using computers early, playing games like Space Invaders, Scrabble, and
GTA Vice City on my siblings' laptops before getting my own—a hand-me-down Dell Latitude running Windows XP.

My first brand-new laptop was an HP, which I got in the 7th grade. Around the same time, I wrote my first
line of code in Python—a number-guessing game—during an intro to programming class. In 8th grade, I joined
CS First, where we built simple games with Scratch. Before that, I was in JET Club, but I switched when I
realized I enjoyed computers more than electronics.

By the 9th grade, I was learning HTML and CSS and designing user interfaces using MS Paint—without knowing
UI/UX was even a field. I had always been drawing, whether in art club or just for fun. Around this time,
I also started using CorelDRAW, though I later switched to Adobe in college.

For years, I thought I'd become a radiologist—no real reason, it just sounded cool. Then in 10th grade, I
switched to aviation because I was fascinated by airplanes. But by my final year of high school, I had
fully embraced programming. Preparing for my Cambridge O' Levels, I learned more Python, got introduced to
data structures and algorithms, and even worked with QBASIC, which I actually enjoyed. That same year, I
received an artistic ingenuity award, which reinforced my love for both design and technology.

I went on to study Computer Science in college, and now I'm a developer and designer, blending bothskills to create.

PS: I’d still love to fly planes or helicopters—maybe not commercially, but definitely for fun.

## About this Site

This site is a work in progress; I'm constantly tweaking it to improve the experience.
It's my little corner of the internet, where I write random thoughts, write about software, design, and
projects I'm working on. I built most of this site myself. For a technical dive into how it works, check out the [Colophon](https://davidumoru.me/colophon).

ps: I would still fly airplanes or copters. maybe not commercially but definately

If you landed here, it probably means you have questions either about who I am
or about this site you're on. I'm gonna attempt to answer them all!

## TL;DR for the people with short attention span

I am a developer and designer freelancer, and I have written on
this blog since 2024. You can email me at hey@davidumoru.me

## Extended Bio

Born in early 2000s in Nigeria where I still live. And yes, I was a Disney kid.
At that age all I cared about was Disney, Nickelodeon and Art.

I had my first computer at the age of 9, I think. It was a Dell Latitude and was a hand me down from my brother.
Prior to that I was already using my elder siblings laptops. So yeah, I got introduced to computers and the internet very early. 
It ran Windows XP and I remember playing a lot of games on it. I played a lot of Space Invaders, Soccer, Scrabble
and my favorite, GTA Vice City.

My first "official new computer" was an HP. I Dad got me this just as I was about to start the 7th grade.
It was a more modern one and it ran Windows 8. I remember being so excited about it. This was where I ran my first line of code.

I've been designing since elementry school. Yes elementry school. At that time i was using
Microsoft Paint to draw and design. I used to draw a lot of cartoon characters and scenes on my sisters laptop then.
I remeber making the designs for websites I wanted to build using MS Paint in middle school. At this time,
I didn't even know UI/UX design was a thing. I was just a kid enjoying the internet.

Back to my first line of code, I wrote my first code in the 7th grade in an intro to programming class. We were taught the basics of
python. My first project was a random number guessing game. Basically the computer generates a random number beteween 1 and 100 and you have to guess it. It would
give hints like number too high or two low. In the 8th grade, a [CS First](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home) got introduced to our extracuricullar activities
and I joined. We worked with [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and we built a number of games with it. Before this i was in the JET Club which i later came to because
the CS club didn't evolve beyond scratch lol. Fast forward to the 9th grade, we were taught HTML and CSS; Another thing I fell in love with. This was the period
I was designing user interfaces using MS Paint. I was also in the art club at some point but cant remeber how the timeline for that was. But thouhout
high school and middle school, I was always drawing. I also picked up CorelDRAW at the beginning of high school. I however use
Adobe now for most of my works (self-taught in my second year of college).

Mind you, all this time, I wasn't planning to study engineering or computer science. I wanted to be a doctor (Radiologist to be specific). Why? I still
don't know till now. I just thought it would be cool. In the 10th grade, I changed my mind to Aviation because airplanes were yet another thing I was
fasinated about.

Now in the 12th grade, I was to write the Cambridge O' Levels. My cambridge CS teacher taught us more python, got us an IDE (had been using notedpad this whole time)
and introduced us to data stuctures, algorithms, psudocode and all that. I also learnt [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) this period. And I actually
really enjoyed it and was good at it.
I got an artistic ingenuity award in high school, fell in love with programming, decided to study CS in college, and here I am now.

## About this Site

This site is a work in progress; I'm constantly tweaking it to improve the experience.
It's my little corner of the internet, where I write random thoughts, write about software, design, and
projects I'm working on. I built most of this site myself. For a technical dive into how it works, check out the [Colophon](https://davidumoru.me/colophon).

ps: I would still fly airplanes or copters. maybe not commercially but definately

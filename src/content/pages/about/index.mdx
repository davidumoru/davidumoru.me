If you landed here, it probably means you have questions either about who I am
or about this site you're on. I'll do my best to answer both.

## TL;DR for the people with short attention spans  

I am a developer and freelance designer, based in Nigeria. I've been coding since middle school and designing since elementary school.
These days I get to do both for work. I've been sharing my work and thoughts here since April 2024. 
You can reach out to me at hey@davidumoru.me.

## Extended Bio  

I was born in the early 2000s in Nigeria, where I still live.
Growing up, I had early access to a computer and the internet, so I spent a lot of time googling stuff.
I was always interested in how things were built: games, websites, robots (I watched a lot of sci-fi, lol).
That curiosity shaped the way I learn: if I find something interesting, I dig into it and figure it out.

I was also always drawn to art and design. I grew up drawing and painting.
When I got my first PC (a Dell Latitude running Windows XP) in elementary school, I discovered MS Paint.
I started playing around with it and spent hours creating pixel art and cartoon characters.

My first actual introduction to programming was in middle school.
We had this "Intro to Python" class when I was in 7th grade.
The class only held about three times, but it was enough to get me interested.
At this point, I didn't even know much of what it was capable of. I just knew I enjoyed what was happening.

Later, we had (yet another three-or-so-class) crash course in web development.
It was on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
This time, I actually somewhat understood how it worked and what it was capable of.
From there, I started building static websites for fun.
I was also designing user interfaces (in MS Paint!) for the websites I was building.
I didn't even know UI design was a thing back then.

By high school, I'd moved on to more advanced tools. I started with CorelDRAW for vector work,
then switched to Illustrator in college when someone recommended it. Figured I'd give it a shot.
These days I'm trying to do my work in Figma, though I still switch between tools depending on the project.
Programming-wise, I got more serious about it in high school, especially while prepping for my Cambridge O' Levels.

So when it came time to pick a college major, Computer Science felt like the obvious choice.
And now, that's what keeps me employed :)

## About this Site  

This site is my little corner of the internet. I'm constantly tweaking it to improve the experience.
I post nicheless notes on whatever catches my interest, and once in a while, I write longer pieces about software or design.

Writing is still relatively new to me, but I've found it helps me understand my own thoughts better.
If nothing else, it's a record of what I was thinking about at any given time.

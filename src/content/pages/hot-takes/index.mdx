- **Dark mode should be the default.** If you use light mode by choice, I don't trust you.
- **AI won't replace us, but people who use AI will.**
- **Your code editor theme matters.** If it looks bad, I'm not using it.
- **The old internet was better.** Everything is too polished now.
- **Skeuomorphism was actually cool.**
- **Not every hobby needs to be monetized.** Let people enjoy things.
- **"Waking up early" isn't a personality trait.** Some of us work better at night.
- **Most meetings could have been an email.**
- **TikTok is the best & worst thing to happen to the internet.**
- **Airplane mode is actually peaceful.**
- **Dark chocolate > Milk chocolate.** It just is.

Can't believe the year's almost over. Realized my last update here was back in January, on the first day of the year.
I feel like a lot's shifted since then. There's been a lot of internal recalibration: spent most of the year trying to cut noise,
relearn how to think clearly, and deciding to move with more intention now. Ideas are sharper now.

Did [HNG](https://hng.tech) once again, met some really cool people, had a bunch of coffee chats with strangers, went through a couple of interviews,
convocated, started a new job, went to a tech summit (as sponsor😜), made new family (not metaphorically), started posting
[my works on X](https://x.com/theumoru/status/1989297407289442732), [watched a bunch of 90s, 2000s, and 2010s romcoms](https://letterboxd.com/umoru/),
redesigned my site, started investing, burned out, and a lot more.

Goal right now is to keep showing up, read more, and get back into intentional writing.

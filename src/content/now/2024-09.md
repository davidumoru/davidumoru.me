Today, I’m taking it slow— allowing myself a moment to pause. Another year around the sun, but this time, it feels different—not just a birthday, but a checkpoint. A moment to look back, take stock, and acknowledge the journey.  

This past year has been a whirlwind. I’ve grown in ways I never anticipated—through wins that pushed me forward, setbacks that tested my resolve, and moments of doubt that taught me resilience. I’ve come to realize that uncertainty isn’t a roadblock; it’s part of the process, a sign that I’m moving toward something bigger.  

The next phase begins tomorrow. But for now, I’m here, present, and grateful.

I've always been exploring all my life. I'm always trying to learn some new skill or pick up a new hobby, just for the fun of it. Right now, I'm actually learning 3D modeling and animation.

Besides coding, I also design. It started out as a passion, then I realized people actually needed my skills, and it sort of became a side gig. I work on all sorts of projects, from prints and layouts to branding and visual identities. I draw and paint too, by the way. I've dabbled in watercolors and even tried my hand at some basic music production.

And the thing is, I genuinely enjoy all of it. Like, the kind of enjoyment where sparks of creativity are flying. It got me thinking: what if the key to my purpose isn't locked away in some dusty corner of computer science, but lies at the intersection of code, design, and maybe even a melody or two lol?

Don't get me wrong, I still love coding. But my love for this artistic expression means I can't ignore the many possibilities.

The problem? There just aren't enough hours in the day. Between lectures, exams, work, and personal projects, squeezing in time for these creative pursuits feels like trying to squeeze an ocean into a teacup.

So, the big question becomes:

### How do I make more time for the things that bring me the most joy and fulfillment?

Here are some ideas I'm brainstorming:

Maybe I'm a total black hole when it comes to time management. I need to have a brutally honest session with myself to see where those precious hours are disappearing.

Could I break down these creative endeavors into smaller, more manageable chunks? Maybe 15 minutes of painting in the morning, or an hour of coding a new feature for my personal project on the weekends.

And I've got to be honest, sometimes I say "yes" a little too readily. Learning to prioritize and politely decline things that drain my energy might free up some much needed creative space.

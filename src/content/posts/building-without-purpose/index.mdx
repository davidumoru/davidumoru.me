There’s a strange relief in building something that doesn’t have to justify itself.
Building with no roadmap, no audience, no monetization strategy, just an idea that wants to exist.  

I used to think every project needed a clear outcome: a finished product, a portfolio piece, a problem solved.
But some of the most formative things I’ve built came from the opposite, impulse-curiosity.  

When you build without purpose, the constraints shift. You’re not optimising for scale or polish; you’re
exploring an idea until it stops being interesting. That’s it. Sometimes it collapses halfway through.
Sometimes it mutates into something else entirely. Either way, you learn what your mind does when it’s not being watched.

A lot of creative paralysis comes from expectation. When every effort is supposed to be meaningful,
most things never get started. Purpose can wait. Direction can emerge later. The act of making is often
the only way to locate what’s worth finishing. This is why I keep a space for unfinished,
directionless work: sketches, prototypes, fragments.

The purpose of building without purpose is to remember how to build freely.

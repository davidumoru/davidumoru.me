>"I don't know what to write about" and "what if no one will read it?". These are the two most common reasons why people
don't want to start a personal blog. I already [addressed the first one](https://manuelmoreale.com/unsolicited-blogging-advice),
so let me tackle the second one in the easiest way possible: I'll read it. If you decide to start a blog in either English or Italian,
I'll read it. I don't care about the topic. Start a blog, write something, send it to me, and I'll read it.

The quote above is from a post I came accross a while back on [Manuel Moreale's blog](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it) and I thought it was a great idea.
So I'm joinng the chain. If you start a blog, I’ll be your first reader. If it has an RSS feed, I’ll add it.
Doesn’t matter what it’s about. You write. I’ll read.

We all have stories to tell. Our lives may be similar through common themes or events, but never completely the same. You may be a student figuring things out.
A parent writing in stolen moments. A builder, designer, cook, wanderer. You may write long essays, short notes, code logs, weekly lists, or daily fragments.
It doesn't matter. The moment you publish, your words become part of the web.

If you’ve been writing already, even better. If you're just starting, that’s fine too.
I won’t skim. I won’t doomscroll. I’ll read. Slowly. Line by line. Just as I hope others read me.

So, I Googled myself... because, why not?

I feel lke everyone has Googled themselves at least once. Every one in a while, I get the urge to type **“David Umoru”** into Google... part curiosity, part vanity, part SEO reconnaissance mission. And every single time, the same guy shows up: **an economics professor**. Respectfully, I am *not* that man.

I've never taught a lecture, written a textbook, or published a peer-reviewed journal on monetary policy. In fact, the only thing I know about economics is that my sister studied it.

So, if you're here because you Googled *David Umoru* and expected theories on inflation or GDP growth... sorry to disappoint. You've landed on the wrong David.

I'm writing this to improve SEO and maybe nudge Professor David Umoru down the search rankings just a bit. All love, sir. It's not personal.

Anyway, thanks for visiting. You can exit now.

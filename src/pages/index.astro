    <h1 class="fs-3">Hello, I'm David :)</h1>
    <p>
      I like making things and experimenting. Mostly with code, sometimes with
      design. So, I decided to major in CS. But depending on who you ask, I'm a
      developer who appreciates good design or designer who writes code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing is new to me, but I've found it helps me understand my own
      thoughts better. So now, I'm experimenting with that too.
    </p>
    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
      It turns out, I might actually really like writing CSS. I've also recently
      been trying to learn more about embedded systems and 3d design. When I'm
      not doing that, I'm probably thinking about plans to travel the world or
      just watching way too much YouTube.
